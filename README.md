# Explaining Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictions with SHAP

Here **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** has been used to interpret the predictions of a machine learning
classification model for breast cancer diagnosis using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer** dataset. The goals:

- Implement SHAP for a binary classification task.
- Analyze feature importance in a clinical context.
- Create interpretable visualizations for clinical insights.
- Compare SHAP values between benign and malignant predictions.
